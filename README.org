- Extracts ~aiService.prompts~ from each database
- Exports prompts to Org-mode files for easy reading and organization
- Supports both multi-workspace and single-file modes
- Functional and class-based Python code with modern best practices

* Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- ~duckdb~
- ~pytest~ (for running tests)
- ~uv~ (for dependency management, optional)
